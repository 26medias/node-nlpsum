The brain of one monkey has been used to control the movements of another, "avatar", monkey, US scientists report..
Brain scans read the master monkey's mind and were used to electrically stimulate the avatar's spinal cord, resulting in controlled movement..
Damage to the spinal cord can stop the flow of information from the brain to the body, leaving people unable to walk or feed themselves..
The scientists at Harvard Medical School said they could not justify paralysing a monkey.Instead, two were used - a master monkey and a sedated avatar..
The avatar had 36 electrodes implanted in the spinal cord and tests were performed to see how stimulating different combinations of electrodes affected movement..
The two monkeys were then hooked up so that the brain scans in one controlled movements in real time in the other.
