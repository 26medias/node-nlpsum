American and British spy agencies conducted a campaign against the WikiLeaks website and its surrounding "human network," according to a new report.
Also included is a 2011 document of an internal NSA wiki with a brief discussion about whether the classification "malicious foreign actor" can be applied to WikiLeaks:

"Can we treat a foreign server who stores or potentially disseminates leaked or stolen data on its server as a ï¿½malicious foreign actor' for the purpose of targeting with no defeats? Examples: WikiLeaks, thepiratebay.org, etc."
There is no indication that WikiLeaks or Pirate Bay was actually classified as a "malicious foreign actor" by the NSA.
The document said that this "appeal exemplifies the start of an international effort to focus the legal element of national power upon non-state actor Assange and the human network that supports WikiLeaks."
Last year, James Goodale, then the chief counsel of The New York Times, told the Columbia Journalism Review that "the biggest challenge to the press today is the threatened persecution of WikiLeaks, and it's absolutely frightening." The Times worked with WikiLeaks in publishing the content of some of the secret documents.
