At least 49 people have been killed in a wave of car bombs in the Iraqi cities of Baghdad and Hilla, officials say.
The blasts come a day after at least 23 people were killed in bomb explosions in the Iraqi capital.
Last month, more than 1,000 people were killed in attacks which mostly hit Shia and government targets.
In the capital Baghdad, bombs in mainly Shia districts killed at least 14 people.
More people were killed in Iraq in 2013 than at any point since 2008, when sectarian violence reached its peak.
