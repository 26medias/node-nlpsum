"Can we treat a foreign server who stores or potentially disseminates leaked or stolen data on its server as a �malicious foreign actor' for the purpose of targeting with no defeats? Examples: WikiLeaks, thepiratebay.org, etc.".
The response by an unnamed NSA employee says, "Let me get back to you." The term "no defeats" is considered to mean "with no protections."
