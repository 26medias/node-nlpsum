Also included is a 2011 document of an internal NSA wiki with a brief discussion about whether the classification "malicious foreign actor" can be applied to WikiLeaks:

"Can we treat a foreign server who stores or potentially disseminates leaked or stolen data on its server as a ï¿½malicious foreign actor' for the purpose of targeting with no defeats? Examples: WikiLeaks, thepiratebay.org, etc."
The response by an unnamed NSA employee says, "Let me get back to you." The term "no defeats" is considered to mean "with no protections." The inclusion of the Pirate Bay site, which has been cited for copyright violations, either indicates that classified material was thought to be part of its inventory, or the national security agency was expanding its scope to include copyright.
An August, 2010 unclassified document also unearthed by The Intercept indicates that the U.S. urged other countries fighting in Afghanistan to file criminal charges against Assange for the publication of more than 70,000 classified documents relating to the war, which had been provided by Army Private First Class Bradley Manning.
The document said that this "appeal exemplifies the start of an international effort to focus the legal element of national power upon non-state actor Assange and the human network that supports WikiLeaks."
Last year, James Goodale, then the chief counsel of The New York Times, told the Columbia Journalism Review that "the biggest challenge to the press today is the threatened persecution of WikiLeaks, and it's absolutely frightening." The Times worked with WikiLeaks in publishing the content of some of the secret documents.
