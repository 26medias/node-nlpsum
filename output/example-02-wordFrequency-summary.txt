At least 49 people have been killed in a wave of car bombs in the Iraqi cities of Baghdad and Hilla, officials say.
Last month, more than 1,000 people were killed in attacks which mostly hit Shia and government targets.
Police say all Tuesday's attacks were caused by cars parked in or near commercial areas and bus stations, reports the Associated Press (AP) news agency.
Al-Jazeera also reports that 13 Iraqi soldiers were killed in a separate battle with Sunni fighters in Fallujah in Anbar province on Tuesday.
More people were killed in Iraq in 2013 than at any point since 2008, when sectarian violence reached its peak.
