At least 49 people have been killed in a wave of car bombs in the Iraqi cities of Baghdad and Hilla, officials say.
The blasts come a day after at least 23 people were killed in bomb explosions in the Iraqi capital.
Last month, more than 1,000 people were killed in attacks which mostly hit Shia and government targets.
Al-Jazeera also reports that 13 Iraqi soldiers were killed in a separate battle with Sunni fighters in Fallujah in Anbar province on Tuesday.
More people were killed in Iraq in 2013 than at any point since 2008, when sectarian violence reached its peak.
